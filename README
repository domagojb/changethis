v.0.0.1

'changethis' is a simple tool written in python used for replacing string occurences in files.

To use create a file named 'change_this' and a file named 'to_this'. In the change_this file,put the string which you want to change, and in the to_this file put the string to which you want to change it. 
This has been made so it's easier to use as single tool.

Run the program from the terminal and add the files you wish to be changed.

No recursion feature as of yet. Will be implemented soon.
